                <p>Niran de Silva K.C. is regularly instructed as counsel in institutional and ad hoc arbitrations, in particular in the telecommunications and aviation sectors. Recent arbitrations include appearing in a multi-million domestic arbitration brought by a telecommunications provider for the costs of monitoring and repairing its network and advising an aviation maintenance provider on an international arbitration against an emanation of a state.

                <p>He is also experienced in court litigation, in particular in the High Court in London, supporting the arbitration process, including interim applications and anti-suit injunctions. He was appointed Queen’s Counsel in 2021. Alongside his practice as a barrister, he sits part-time as a judge in the English Family Courts and Employment Tribunals.

                <p>He has experience as sitting as an arbitrator in LCIA arbitrations. In the past, he has acted as tribunal secretary, including a number in which Matthieu de Boisséson was an arbitrator.

                <p>Niran studied History at Oxford University before doing the law conversion course at City University, London. He worked as an equity derivatives analyst and broker at Barclays Capital before joining a leading commercial set of barristers at the London bar where he currently practises. He lectures for commercial seminar providers on the subject of international arbitration.
                
                <p>The 2022 edition of Chambers and Partners states: <i>“I always feel very comfortable in the knowledge that he has all the background and context needed, and he is very easy-going but he is also very forensic in the way that he can grapple with large amounts of evidence. On his feet he is very impressive and he has such a good knowledge of all the paperwork, even when there is a lot of it”</i>.    

                <p>The 2022 edition of Legal 500 states that he is <i>“an excellent choice for employment/commercial cross-over work”</i>.
